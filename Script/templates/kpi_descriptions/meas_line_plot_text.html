visualises all measurements (a), and the 'majority' of the measurements (b).
The 'majority' is here defined as values within 1.5 times the measurements
interquartile range (IQR; shown as dark blue lines in a). These cut-offs can
greatly improve the measurement visualisation when extremely high or low values
are present. The colors represent the QC flag assigned by the automatic QC: 2
(good), 3 (questionable), and 4 (bad).
