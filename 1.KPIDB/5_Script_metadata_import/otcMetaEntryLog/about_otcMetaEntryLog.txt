We record all the fact changes separately in a log. I have attached the current complete content of such a log for the OTC metadata, exported to a CSV file. The columns are:


id - the sequential number of the change

tstamp - time stamp for when the change has occurred

ASSERTION - whether the change is an addition of a fact (i.e. assertion) or a removal (i.e. retraction): t for "true", f for "false"

TYPE - type of statement: 1 for literal values (can be strings, date, numbers), 0 for values which are themselves resources

SUBJECT - the resource that the statement is about

PREDICATE - the property that the statement claims the subject to have

OBJECT - the value of the property that the subject has

LITATTR - for the cases of TYPE 1 statements, the XML Schema type of the literal value (e.g. xsd:string, xsd:dateTime, xsd:float), empty otherwise
